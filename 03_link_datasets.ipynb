    "becomes William, Chuck and Charlie becomes Charles, etc. The PVS keeps both the\n",
    "original name (Bill) and the converted name (William) for matching. PVS also has a fake\n",
    "name table to blank names such as “Queen of the House” or “Baby Girl.” The name data\n",

    "\n",
    "> The Name Search Module also accounts for instances where census records contain a nickname.\n",

    "> these observations, one record for the nickname and one record for the formal name.\n",
    "> For example, if the input record has the name “Bill Smith,” the formatting program will add\n",

    "entire duplicate records are made with each name (nickname and formal).\n",
